  <h1>dESPatch</h1>
  <p>dESPatch is a library and webservice to provide easy firmware updates for <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32/overview">ESP32-based</a> products that use the <a href="https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32">Arduino-ESP32</a> framework.</p>
  <p>dESPatch is safe:
  <ul>
    <li>dESPatch uses HTTPS encryption to encrypt the traffic between client and server</li>
    <li>dESPatch verifies the TLS certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacs</li>
    <li>dESPatch uses API keys to prevent unauthorized firmware downloads</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>dESPatch is easy to use:
  <ul>
    <li>dESPatch requires only a few lines of code in your application</li>
    <li>dESPatch provides example code tailored to your account and products</li>
    <li>dESPatch provides an overview of registered devices including which software versions they are running</li>
    <li>dESPatch allows you to easily create new software releases</li>
    <li>dESPatch allows you to easily switch specific devices to specific software releases, for example to select a few devices for beta testing</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>dESPatch consists of three components:
  <ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/admarschoonen/dESPatch">library</a> that you can include in your <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> sketch
  <li>A webservice where you can upload the binary generated by Arduino and where your ESP32 will regularly check for firmware updates (this website; source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/admarschoonen/dESPatch-web">here</a>)
  <li>A client that automatically uploads the binary from Arduino to ease the development process (not yet available)
  </ul>
